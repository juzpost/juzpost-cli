Schedule and auto-post short-form videos to TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram, and X from the command line. `juzpost-cli` is a scriptable social media scheduler for creators, agencies, and developers who want to schedule posts, run a content calendar, and cross-post clips without leaving the terminal.

It's the command-line client for [JuzPost](https://www.juzpost.com), a social media scheduler built for short-form video. If you've used Buffer, Hootsuite, Later, SocialBee, or Postiz and wanted a CLI-first workflow you can automate, this is built for that.

```bash
npm install -g juzpost-cli
juzpost auth login
juzpost schedule --group "all-channels" --min-per-day 2
```

## Why juzpost-cli

- **Runs from your terminal.** Schedule, post, and manage social content with commands or scripts. No dashboard to click through.
- **Schedules automatically.** Pick an account group and a minimum number of posts per day, and it spreads your drafts across the best preset times for your timezone.
- **Posts to many accounts at once.** Push one video to TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram, and X in a single command.
- **Fits into automation.** Run it from cron, CI, or a clipping pipeline to post on a content calendar. Pipe `--json` output into whatever you want.
- **Secure, revocable login.** Browser-based device-code auth. Tokens stay revocable from your dashboard whenever you need.
- **Small footprint.** One runtime dependency, native `fetch`, Node 18 or newer.

juzpost auth login

# 2. See your connected accounts, groups, and workspace
juzpost accounts
juzpost groups
juzpost workspace

# 3. Create a draft from a video file
juzpost posts create --file ./clip.mp4 \

  --hashtags asmr sleep rain relaxing satisfying

# 4. Smart-schedule every draft across a group at 2 posts per day

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `juzpost auth login` / `logout` / `whoami` | Device-code login, sign out, show identity |
| `juzpost account status` | Plan and entitlements |
| `juzpost accounts [--platform --group-id]` | List connected social accounts |
| `juzpost groups [--name]` | List channel groups (account presets) |
| `juzpost workspace` | Timezone and default posting times |
| `juzpost posts list [--status --from --to]` | List posts (drafts, scheduled, posted) |
| `juzpost posts create [--file --title --hashtags …]` | Upload media and create a draft |
| `juzpost posts schedule <id> --account <id…> [--at --alt --label]` | Schedule one post; `--alt` and `--label` set Bluesky alt text and content warnings |
| `juzpost schedule --group --min-per-day [--dry-run]` | Smart-schedule drafts across a group |

Every list command supports cursor pagination (`--limit`, `--cursor`, `--all`), sorting (`--sort`, `--order`), and `--json` for scripting.

```bash
juzpost posts list --status scheduled --json | jq '.data[].title'
```

Bluesky alt text is one description per file, in the order the post's files are attached (`""` leaves a file undescribed). Content warnings are `sexual` (Suggestive), `nudity` or `porn` (Adult), plus `graphic-media`, and only apply to posts with images or video. `--label` works without `--alt`; every file then goes out undescribed:

```bash
juzpost posts schedule <id> --account <bluesky-id> --at 2026-09-20T09:00:00Z \
  --alt "A calendar in week view" "" --label graphic-media
```

## How smart scheduling works

The `juzpost schedule` command turns a pile of drafts into a posting calendar. It works in four steps.

1. Resolve a group into the social accounts you want to post to.
2. Read your timezone and preset times from your workspace settings.
3. Spread the drafts across days to hit your `--min-per-day` cadence. It picks the best preset slots, stays DST-aware, and skips any time already in the past.
4. Schedule each post to every account in the group.

```bash
# 10 drafts, 3 per day, starting tomorrow, only on these times
juzpost schedule --group "shorts" --min-per-day 3 --times 09:30 14:00 19:00
```

## Use cases

- **Creators.** Batch a week of TikToks and YouTube Shorts in one command.
- **Clipping pages and agencies.** Auto-post clips on a fixed cadence across many accounts.
- **Repurposing pipelines.** Wire it after a VOD-to-shorts step to schedule the output. The `--json` flag makes it pipe-friendly.
- **Developers.** Script your posting in CI, cron, or a Makefile instead of a SaaS dashboard.

---

## Configuration

- **Token storage.** Your auth token is stored at `~/.config/juzpost/config.json` with mode `0600`. It is never logged.
- **Custom API URL.** Override the base URL with `--base <url>` or the `JUZPOST_URL` environment variable.
- **Revoke anytime.** Remove a CLI token from your JuzPost dashboard settings. A hard delete returns an instant 401.
